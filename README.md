The website you are viewing is a platform where I can showcase the work I have completed for the eyes of employers, fellow programmers, and even for my friends and family to see. Beyond this, the website is a way to satiate my desire to challenge myself, learn something new, and create something useful and attractive (hopefully). I hope you will enjoy viewing my site as much as I enjoy creating it.
